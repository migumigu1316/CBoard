* Lightweight architecture and concise source code, the entire project does not rely on any third-party multi-dimensional analysis tools, if you are struggling in Mondrain, CBoard could be a nice alternative for you.
* Easy to implement your own DataProvider to connect any data source. Even for expensive commercial BI suite, it's not possible to connect all the NOSQL and NewSQL data source in the era of big data. Due to the schema of NOSQL are various, such as hash tables, arrays, trees, maps, etc., different people using the same NoSQL products designed Schema may vary widely. The user who most familiar with their storage schema are the user themselves. And it's easy to find a Java programmers to code a Class to connect their own data source. So we leave this part of work to the end user with an easy extended data connection framework in CBoard
